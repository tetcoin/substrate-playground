## Support

Documentation can be found at [paritytech.github.io/substrate-playground/](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-playground/) (and its source [here](./docs/))

### Integrate

Playground can be [integrated](docs/INTEGRATION.md) in external pages. This opens the door for more advanced usage e.g. interactive tutorials.

### Contribute a template

Extra `template` (custom docker images) can be [created](docs/CUSTOM_TEMPLATE.md) and made available on playground.

## Roadmap
